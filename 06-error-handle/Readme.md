# PowerShell Scripting Mastery

## Error Handling and Debugging

Welcome to the Error Handling and Debugging section of the PowerShell Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, you'll gain an understanding of basic error handling techniques in PowerShell and learn how to implement effective debugging practices for PowerShell scripts.

### Basic Error Handling Techniques

#### 1. **Try-Catch Blocks:**
   - Utilize `Try` and `Catch` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
     ```powershell
     try {
         # Code that may cause an error
     }
     catch {
         Write-Host "An error occurred: $_"
     }
     ```

#### 2. **Throwing Custom Errors:**
   - Use `throw` to generate custom errors with meaningful messages.
     ```powershell
     function Divide-Numbers {
         param(
             [int]$dividend,
             [int]$divisor
         )
         if ($divisor -eq 0) {
             throw "Cannot divide by zero."
         }
         return $dividend / $divisor
     }
     ```

#### 3. **ErrorActionPreference:**
   - Set `$ErrorActionPreference` to control how PowerShell responds to errors.
     ```powershell
     $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
     ```

### Debugging Practices

#### 1. **Write-Debug Cmdlet:**
   - Incorporate `Write-Debug` statements to provide debug information.
     ```powershell
     function MyFunction {
         Write-Debug "Entering MyFunction"
         # Function logic
     }
     ```

#### 2. **Breakpoints:**
   - Set breakpoints to pause script execution for inspection.
     ```powershell
     Set-PSBreakpoint -Script .\MyScript.ps1 -Line 10
     ```

#### 3. **Step Into, Over, and Out Of:**
   - Use debugging commands like `Step-Into`, `Step-Over`, and `Step-Out` for fine-grained control.
     ```powershell
     Step-Into
     ```

### How to Use This Guide

1. **Error Handling Practice:**
   - Implement `Try-Catch` blocks and custom error handling in your scripts to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.

2. **Debugging Experimentation:**
   - Add `Write-Debug` statements in critical areas of your script and experiment with breakpoints to understand script behavior during execution.

3. **Documentation Review:**
   - Refer to the [PowerShell Documentation - about_Try_Catch_Finally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-try-catch-finally) and [PowerShell Documentation - about_Debuggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-debuggers) for more detailed information.
