# PowerShell Scripting Mastery

## Scripting for Cloud Environments

Welcome to the Scripting for Cloud Environments section of the PowerShell Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, you will learn how to develop scripts for automating tasks in cloud environments using PowerShell. Additionally, you will explore cloud-native scripting languages and tools with PowerShell.

### Developing Scripts for Cloud Automation with PowerShell

#### 1. **Azure PowerShell Module:**
   - Leverage the Azure PowerShell module to automate tasks such as provisioning resources, managing Azure services, and deploying applications.
     ```powershell
     # Example: Creating an Azure resource group
     New-AzResourceGroup -Name "MyResourceGroup" -Location "East US"
     ```

#### 2. **AWS Tools for PowerShell:**
   - Utilize the AWS Tools for PowerShell to automate tasks on Amazon Web Services (AWS), including managing EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and more.
     ```powershell
     # Example: Launching an EC2 instance on AWS
     New-EC2Instance -ImageId ami-12345678 -InstanceType t2.micro
     ```

### Exploring Cloud-Native Scripting Languages and Tools with PowerShell

#### 1. **Azure CLI Integration:**
   - Integrate with the Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI) in PowerShell scripts for a combination of Azure services and CLI capabilities.
     ```powershell
     # Example: Using Azure CLI command in PowerShell
     az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location "East US"
     ```

#### 2. **Google Cloud SDK Integration:**
   - Integrate with the Google Cloud SDK in PowerShell for managing resources and services on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
     ```powershell
     # Example: Using gcloud command in PowerShell
     gcloud compute instances create my-instance --image-family debian --image-project debian-cloud
     ```
