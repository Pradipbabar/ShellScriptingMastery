# Command Line Basics

Welcome to the "Command Line Basics" section of our comprehensive guide. This module is designed to help you become comfortable with the command line interface (CLI) and familiarize yourself with common Unix commands along with their options.

## Getting Started

### What is the Command Line?

- The command line is a text-based interface where users can interact with their computer by typing commands.

### Why Learn the Command Line?

- Efficiency: Performing tasks quickly without a graphical user interface.
- Automation: Automating repetitive tasks with scripts.
- Remote Access: Accessing and managing remote servers.

  - Displays the current directory path.

- **`ls` (List):**
  - Lists files and directories in the current directory.

- **`cd` (Change Directory):**
  - Changes the current directory.

### File and Directory Operations

- **`mkdir` (Make Directory):**
  - Creates a new directory.

- **`touch` :**
