# PowerShell Scripting Mastery

## Advanced Process Management

Welcome to the Advanced Process Management section of the PowerShell Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, you will dive into advanced concepts such as process synchronization, inter-process communication (IPC) with PowerShell, and handling signals in scripts.

### Process Synchronization and Inter-Process Communication

#### 1. **Synchronization Techniques:**
   - Explore techniques like semaphores or named mutexes to synchronize processes.
     ```powershell
     $mutex = New-Object Threading.Mutex($false, "MyMutex")
     $mutex.WaitOne()
     # Critical section code
     $mutex.ReleaseMutex()
     ```

#### 2. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**
   - Utilize IPC methods like named pipes or memory-mapped files for communication between processes.
     ```powershell
     $pipe = New-Object System.IO.Pipes.NamedPipeServerStream("MyPipe", [System.IO.Pipes.PipeDirection]::InOut)
     $pipe.WaitForConnection()
     $reader = New-Object System.IO.StreamReader($pipe)
     $data = $reader.ReadLine()
     ```

### Handling Signals in PowerShell Scripts

#### 1. **Signal Handling Basics:**
   - Understand how to handle signals or events in PowerShell scripts.
     ```powershell
     $event = New-Object System.Threading.ManualResetEvent($false)
     Register-ObjectEvent -InputObject $event -EventName Set -Action { Write-Host "Signal received!" }
     ```

#### 2. **Graceful Script Termination:**
   - Implement graceful script termination on receiving a specific signal.
     ```powershell
     function Terminate-Script {
         Write-Host "Script termination signal received."
         # Cleanup and exit script gracefully
     }

     $event = New-Object System.Threading.ManualResetEvent($false)
     Register-ObjectEvent -InputObject $event -EventName Set -Action { Terminate-Script }
     ```

### How to Use This Guide

1. **Synchronization and IPC Practice:**
   - Experiment with process synchronization using techniques like semaphores and explore IPC methods such as named pipes in your scripts.

2. **Signal Handling Experimentation:**
   - Practice handling signals or events in your PowerShell scripts for better control and responsiveness.

3. **Documentation Review:**
   - Refer to the [PowerShell Documentation - Threading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-about_jobs) for more detailed information on threading and [PowerShell Documentation - Register-ObjectEvent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-about_events) for event handling.
