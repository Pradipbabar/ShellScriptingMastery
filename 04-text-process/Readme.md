# PowerShell Scripting Mastery

## Text Processing Basics

Welcome to the Text Processing Basics section of the PowerShell Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, you will explore fundamental text processing with PowerShell cmdlets and gain an understanding of regular expressions for pattern matching.

### Basic Text Processing with PowerShell Cmdlets

#### 1. **Select-String:**
   - Utilize `Select-String` to search for text patterns in files or strings.
     ```powershell
     Get-Content .\SampleFile.txt | Select-String "pattern"
     ```

#### 2. **Get-Content:**
   - Use `Get-Content` to retrieve the content of a text file.
     ```powershell
     Get-Content .\SampleFile.txt
     ```

#### 3. **Out-File:**
   - Employ `Out-File` to write text content to a file.
     ```powershell
     "New text content" | Out-File .\NewFile.txt
     ```

#### 4. **Add-Content:**
   - Append content to a file using `Add-Content`.
     ```powershell
     "Additional content" | Add-Content .\ExistingFile.txt
     ```

### Regular Expressions for Pattern Matching

#### 1. **Literal Matches:**
   - Use literal text for straightforward matches.
     ```powershell
     Select-String -Pattern "exact phrase" .\SampleFile.txt
     ```

#### 2. **Character Classes:**
   - Employ character classes for matching specific character sets.
     ```powershell
     Select-String -Pattern "[aeiou]" .\SampleFile.txt
     ```

#### 3. **Quantifiers:**
   - Use quantifiers for matching repeated patterns.
     ```powershell
     Select-String -Pattern "ab{2,3}" .\SampleFile.txt
     ```

#### 4. **Anchors:**
   - Utilize anchors to match patterns at the beginning or end of a line.
     ```powershell
     Select-String -Pattern "^Start" .\SampleFile.txt
     ```
