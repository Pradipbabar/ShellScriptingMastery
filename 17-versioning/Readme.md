# PowerShell Scripting Mastery

## Advanced Version Control and Collaboration

Welcome to the Advanced Version Control and Collaboration section of the PowerShell Scripting Mastery guide. In this section, you will master advanced Git workflows, explore Git hooks for automation and custom workflows using PowerShell, and learn how to collaborate effectively with distributed teams using Git features with PowerShell.

### Mastering Advanced Git Workflows with PowerShell

#### 1. **Feature Branch Workflow:**
   - Implement the feature branch workflow using PowerShell, creating and merging feature branches for a streamlined development process.
     ```powershell
     # Example: Creating and switching to a new feature branch
     git checkout -b feature/new-feature
     ```

#### 2. **Git Rebase Workflow:**
   - Master the Git rebase workflow to maintain a clean and linear commit history, enhancing readability and simplifying collaboration.
     ```powershell
     # Example: Rebasing feature branch onto the main branch
     git checkout feature/new-feature
     git rebase main
     ```

### Exploring Git Hooks for Automation and Custom Workflows with PowerShell

#### 1. **Pre-commit Hook:**
   - Implement a pre-commit hook using PowerShell to enforce code standards, run tests, or perform checks before committing changes.
     ```powershell
     # Example: PowerShell script for a pre-commit hook
     # (Place this script in the .git\hooks\pre-commit file)
     ```

#### 2. **Post-merge Hook:**
   - Utilize a post-merge hook to automate tasks after a merge, such as updating dependencies or triggering deployment scripts.
     ```powershell
     # Example: PowerShell script for a post-merge hook
     # (Place this script in the .git\hooks\post-merge file)
     ```

### Collaborating Effectively with Distributed Teams Using Git Features with PowerShell

#### 1. **Git Pull and Fetch:**
   - Use PowerShell to perform Git pull and fetch operations, keeping your local repository up-to-date with changes from remote branches.
     ```powershell
     # Example: Git pull to update the local repository
     git pull origin main
     ```

#### 2. **Git Push and Remote Branches:**
   - Leverage PowerShell to push changes to remote repositories and manage remote branches effectively.
     ```powershell
     # Example: Git push to update remote branches
     git push origin feature/new-feature
     ```
